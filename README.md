# Background_Clusters

This repository deals with my side project at MSU REU Summer 2023, working with Dr. David Turner. I was given the task of modeling background clusters in a LOVOCCS fits image (116 of them). From this website, (https://www.scidb.cn/en/detail?dataSetId=7797b553a23846a187b7746d8fc555a5) I downloaded three files (galaxy_clusters_desdr2.fits, galaxy_clusters_desidr9.fits, and galaxy_clusters_hscpdr3_wide.fits) to match the nearest clusters from these data to the LOVOCCS clusters.
